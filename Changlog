Changes of v2.3 compared to v2.2:

1. Improvements on classification
Some top ranked yet poor descriptors are excluded. For example in the classification of two data group,
if one domain with rectangular shape intersects another domain also with rectangular shape, then there is a non-zero overlap 
area but could be without data points inside the overlap region. Such descriptors may be ranked at top positions because there 
may be no or very few data_in_overlap which is used as the first metric for model ranking. These descriptors are not 
desired because of the actual big overlap between domains. Now in the version 2.3, such descriptors are supressed.

2. Compilation using GNU Fortran compilers enabled
The code compiled using Intel ifort was found 1.5X faster than that using GNU gfortran at the same optimization level -O2. 
Different compilers may lead to slightly different total feature spaces, e.g. due to numerical noise, and the difference is 
basically on the unimportant features. Thus, the choice of compiler should make no changes on the SISSO results (best models), 
as seen from my tests, yet for the reason of speed Intel compilers are recommended.
