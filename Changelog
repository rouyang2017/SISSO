V3.2
-----
For better clarity, the following keywords/folders are renamed.
keywords:
opset --> ops
dimclass --> funit
maxfval_lb --> fmax_min
maxfval_up --> fmax_max
subs_sis --> nf_sis
method --> method_so
L1L0_size4L0 --> nl1l0
width --> bwidth
nm_output --> nmodels
files/folders:
feature_space --> SIS_subspaces
Uspace.name --> Uspace.expressions
pfdimension --> feature_units
The folder "residual" is removed
******* User guide is now available in the file SISSO_guide.pdf *******


v3.1
-----
1. New feature: Variable selection assisted SISSO
2. New feature: Sign-constrained multi-task learning
3. The keyword 'rung' is redundant and removed, because the other keyword
'maxcomplexity' (now renamed as fcomplexity) alone is sufficient to control the feature complexity and the
feature-space size. In the code, the 'rung' is now automatically adjusted
according to fcomplexity=0 for rung=0, fcomplexity=1 for rung=1,
fcomplexity=2/3 for rung=2, and fcomplexity=4/5/6/7 for rung=3, and so forth.
4. All system-calls in the program have been replaced by intrinsic Fortran functions
5. SISSO now accept the format of train.dat with space, comma, and tab as separators.
6. The value for the keyword 'dimclass' can be overwritten if a file called
'pfdimension' is detected. The file 'pfdimension' enables flexible setting of
the dimension (unit) matrix of the input primary features. See the matrix format in the SISSO.out.



v3.0.2
------
1. Bug fixed for "restart"
2. Bug fixed for calculating domain-overlap in classification
3. The recursive feature construction is made more flexible by allowing a
different set of operators for each repeat. E.g. with rung=3, opset can be three sets of
operators separated by comma: opset ='operators set1','operators set2','operators set3'. 
If opset(1), opset(2),opset(3) are the same, then simply opset='operators set1'.
4. The SIS-selected subspace size is made more flexible by
allowing a different size for each dimension. E.g. with desc_dim=3, the
subs_sis can be set to subs_sis=value1,value2,value3. If value1, value2 and
value3 are the same, then simply subs_sis=value1.
5. Tools added to 'utilities': k-fold-cv, leave-percent-out-cv, table of extended Shannon radii.


v3.0
----
1. Added new parameters: fit_intercept, isconvex (see SISSO.in for introduction)
2. Removed redundant parameters: ndimtype,fs_size_DI, fs_size_L0, calc
3. Bugs fixed for the "residual" of classification
4. The problem that when the generated total feature space is smaller than the
value of subs_sis as specified in SISSO.in the code collapses is solved in this version 
by automatically adjusting the parameter subs_sis to the actual total-space size.
5. The corresponding coefficients of all the competing models given in the folder
"models" are now available.


v2.4
----
1. identification of 3D descriptor for classification enabled
2. new folder 'utilities' added to include useful tools for analyzing the results
3. input templates for multi-task learning added to the folder 'input_template'
4. new keyword 'task_weighting' added for multi-task learning of continuous properties.
5. keyword 'task' renamed to 'calc'
6. keyword 'nprop' renamed to 'ntask'
7. values for the keyword 'metric' renamed from 'LS_RMSE' and 'LS_MaxAE' to 'RMSE' and 'MaxAE', respectively.
8. 'roundoff error' problem fixed. SISSO involves writing (FC steps) and reading (DI steps) of features during 
the run. In all the previous version, the precision of the output features data were set to only 5 significant 
figures, which is insufficient especially when features have large values, e.g. >10^5. Large roundoff error may 
cause nonoptimal results. In this version, the precision of the output features data has been changed to 
have 10 significant figures.

v2.3
----
1. Improvements on classification
Some top ranked yet poor descriptors are excluded. For example in the classification of two data group, 
if one domain with rectangular shape intersects another domain also with rectangular shape, 
then there is a non-zero overlap area but could be without data points inside the overlap region. 
Such descriptors may be ranked at top positions because there may be no or very few data_in_overlap which is 
used as the first metric for model ranking. These descriptors are not desired because of the actual big 
overlap between domains. Now in the version 2.3, such descriptors are supressed.
2. Compilation using GNU Fortran compilers enabled 
The code compiled using Intel ifort was found ~1.5X faster than that using GNU gfortran at the same optimization 
level -O2. Different compilers may lead to slightly different total feature spaces, e.g. due to numerical noise, 
and the difference is basically on the unimportant features. Thus, the choice of compiler should make no changes 
on the SISSO results (best models), as seen from my tests, yet for the reason of speed Intel compilers are recommended.


v2.2
----
1. input template files are provided for both quantitative (regression) and qualitative (classification) properties
2. DI is made faster (1~2X speed, especially when subs_sis is large)
3. for nprop>1 (multi-task learning), the overall scores/errors of properties is calculated with quadratic mean
4. Parallelization I/O bug fixed
5. Input parameters CV_fold and CV_repeat removed


v2.1
----
1. Parallelization I/O bug fixed
2. Input parameters CV_fold and CV_repeat removed
